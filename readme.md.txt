This tool simulates how hedge funds and institutional investors used **Total Return Swaps (TRS)** with offshore structures to receive UK dividend returns without paying UK corporation tax ‚Äî and how HMRC responded with **Section 695A of the Corporation Tax Act 2009**.

It combines:
- üßæ Financial modeling (synthetic exposure, leverage)
- ‚öñÔ∏è UK tax law interpretation
- üìâ Risk analysis (hidden leverage, margin calls)
- üíª Interactive simulation (Streamlit + Pandas)

Perfect for students, analysts, and compliance officers exploring **regulatory arbitrage**, **synthetic instruments**, and **anti-avoidance rules**.
